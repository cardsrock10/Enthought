    "In this exercise, we use the text vectorizers provided in `sklearn` to transform sentences into numerical vectors, and check if sentences using \"Python\" with the same meaning have similar vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `CountVectorizer` to transform the sentences given below to numerical vectors, and print the result. Only set `lowercase=True` as input argument to `CountVectorizer`. (The output of the vectorizer is a sparse array; use the method `toarray()` to print the result as a regular Numpy array);\n",
    "2. Print the list of extracted features (see the `get_feature_names` method of `CountVectorizer`);\n",
    "3. Compute the pairwise distance between the vector representations of the sentences using the `cosine_distances` function, defined in `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` [1]. Which sentences are closer in the feature space?\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 1-3, removing stopwords (using the `stop_words` optional argument of `CountVectorizer`).\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 1-3 using a `TfidfVectorizer`.\n",
    "6. Finally, use `CountVectorizer` using your own processing method, including tokenization, normalization, and stemming (use the `analyzer` argument of `CountVectorizer` to use your processing method, as discussed in the class slides).\n",

    "[1] `cosine_distances` is a distance measure that is independent of the length of the vectors, see http://bit.ly/1DcbLZx for a detailed description"
